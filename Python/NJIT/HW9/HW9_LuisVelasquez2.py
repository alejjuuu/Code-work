Problem 2
Write a function named file_stats that takes one string parameter (in_file) that is the name of an existing text file. The function file_stats should calculate three statistics about in_file: the number of lines it contains, the number of words and the number of characters, and print the three statistics on separate lines. For example, the following would be correct input and output:
>>> file_stats('created_equal.txt')
lines 2
words 13
characters 72
Note: The number of characters may vary slightly between operating systems. Similarly, the number of lines may vary by 1 line, depending on the method used to calculate it.
