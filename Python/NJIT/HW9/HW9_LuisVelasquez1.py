Problem 1
Write a function file_copy that takes two string parameters (in_file and out_file) and copies the content of in_file into out_file. Assume that in_file exists before file_copy is called. For example, the following would be correct input and output:
>>> file_copy('created_equal.txt', 'copy.txt')
>>> copy_f = open('copy.txt')
>>> copy_f.read()
'We hold these truths to be self-evident,\nthat all men are created equal\n'
